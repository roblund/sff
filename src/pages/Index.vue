    <h2>Help us make sure no one in the Gallatin Valley goes to bed hungry.</h2>
    <p>
      Community food and fund drives provide nutritious food and vital operating
      funds for HRDC's Gallatin Valley Food Bank while raising awareness of
      hunger issues in our community. Food drives provide some of the healthiest
      and highest-quality food Gallatin Valley Food Bank receives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spring for Food drive is an opportunity to support a sustainable
      supply of food during a time when donations are less frequent.
    </p>

    <h2>How can you help?</h2>
    <p>
      It’s easy to get involved. Invite your family and friends to join you on
      April 5th to collect food at one of the participating grocery stores in
      our area. Your contribution (food, funds, or time) will support the
      distribution of groceries to area families, in addition to supplementing
      the KidsPack and KidsPantry programs, which provide weekend nutritional
      support so kids show up ready to learn each Monday.
    </p>

    <p>
      This year, we’re setting up central donation points at participating
      supermarkets in Bozeman and Belgrade so that people can donate as they’re
      shopping. To volunteer click

    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Please fill out the volunteer form below and select a grocery store
        close to where you live. Volunteers are encouraged to pull together a
        small group of friends and family to join them in making this event a
        huge success.
      </p>
      <p>What we are asking:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Before the Event:</strong> Sign up on the form below to
          register at one of the local grocery stores for a two-hour shift. This
          is a large volunteer effort, so please make sure you are available at
          the time you sign up for, as rescheduling will be a challenge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Day of the Event:</strong> Show up at the supermarket
          you’ve signed up for. Employees of the food bank or volunteers from
          the previous shift will provide training. Volunteers will be
          responsible for handing out wish lists of desired donation items and
          receiving donations in our watermelon bins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>After the Event:</strong> As the food drive winds down, a
          truck or van will come to your location to pick up our food bins. The
          final volunteer shift (1:45-3 PM) will be responsible for waiting
          until the truck arrives. We expect all pick-up vehicles to arrive
          before by 3 but, if you are on the last shift, make sure your schedule
          is flexible in case there are unanticipated delays.
        </li>
      </ol>
