    <h2>Come and join us</h2>
    <p>
      It’s easy to get involved. Invite your family and friends to join you on
      April 6th to collect food at one of ten grocery stores in our area. Your
      contribution will support over 1,200 local families that receive emergency
      food boxes each month, not to mention specific programs like KidsPack and
      Kids’ Pantries, which helps prevent hunger for our area school children.
      This year’s Spring for Food Drive has a companion event: Childhood Hunger
      Awareness Week. This means we’re going to do it a little differently.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’ve volunteered or donated in the past, then you know that Spring
      for Food is usually a door-to-door collection process. That’s changing
      this year. We’re setting up central donation points at every supermarket
      in Bozeman and Belgrade so that people can donate as they’re shopping. To

    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Please fill out the volunteer form below and select a grocery store
        close to where you live. Volunteers are encouraged to pull together a
        small group of friends and family to join them in making this event a
        huge success.
      </p>
      <p>What we are asking:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Before the Event:</strong> Sign up on the form below to
          register at one of ten local grocery stores for a two-hour shift. This
          is a large volunteer effort, so please make sure you are available at
          the time you sign up for, as rescheduling will be a challenge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Day of the Event:</strong> Show up at the supermarket
          you’ve signed up for. Employees of the food bank or volunteers from
          the previous shift will provide training. Volunteers will be
          responsible for handing out wish lists of desired donation items and
          receiving donations in our watermelon bins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>After the Event:</strong> As the food drive winds down, a
          truck or van will come to your location to pick up our food bins. The
          final volunteer shift (2 PM - 4:15 PM) will be responsible for waiting
          until the truck arrives. We expect all pick-up vehicles to arrive
          before 4:15 but, if you are on the last shift, make sure your schedule
          is flexible in case there are unanticipated delays.
        </li>
      </ol>

            During the 2017-2018 fiscal year, the Gallatin Valley Food Bank
            distributed 2,002,170 pounds of food.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Gallatin Valley Food Bank serves an average 1240 households
            (roughly 3,228 individuals) every month through the Emergency Food
            Box Program at our Bozeman location and our satellite service in
            Belgrade.
          </li>
          <li>
            On average, 7,435 pounds (3.71 tons) of food is distributed to
            families every day.
          </li>
          <li>
            15% of households are single-parent families, 29% of households have
            at least one child, and 30% are under 18.
          </li>
          <li>
            Out of that total, 137,097 pounds of food went to other area
            non-profits, the Fork and Spoon, CSFP and KidsPack. This took an
            extraordinary effort by hundreds of volunteers and dedicated staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Volunteers are vital to fighting hunger. Our volunteers are the
            backbone of our efforts and during the last fiscal year, our
            volunteers contributed tens of thousands of hours to help alleviate
            hunger in the Gallatin Valley.
