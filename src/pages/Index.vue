    <h2>Come and join us</h2>
    <p>
      It’s easy to get involved. Invite your family and friends to join you on
      April 6th to collect food at one of ten grocery stores in our area. Your
      contribution will support over 1,200 local families that receive emergency
      food boxes each month, not to mention specific programs like KidsPack and
      Kids’ Pantries, which helps prevent hunger for our area school children.
      This year’s Spring for Food Drive has a companion event: Childhood Hunger
      Awareness Week. This means we’re going to do it a little differently.

      If you’ve volunteered or donated in the past, then you know that Spring
      for Food is usually a door-to-door collection process. That’s changing
      this year. We’re setting up central donation points at every supermarket
      in Bozeman and Belgrade so that people can donate as they’re shopping. To
      volunteer click
