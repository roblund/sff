    <h2>Help us combat hunger in the Gallatin Valley:</h2>
    <p>
      Community food and fund drives provide nutritious food and vital operating
      funds for Gallatin Valley Food Bank while raising awareness of hunger
      issues in our community. Food drives provide some of the healthiest and
      highest-quality food the Gallatin Valley Food Bank receives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spring for Food drive is an opportunity to support a sustainable
      supply of food during a time when donations are less frequent. In
      addition, with the onset of COVID-19 last March, the Food Bank halted all
      food drive efforts and did not begin taking individual donations until
      October of 2020 (due to safety concerns) This significantly impacted their
      food supply.
    </p>

    <h2>How can you help?</h2>
    <p>
      It’s easy to get involved. Invite your family and friends to join you on
      April 10th to collect food at one of the participating grocery stores in
      our area. Your contribution (food, funds, or time) will support the
      distribution of groceries to area families, in addition to supplementing
      the KidsPack and KidsPantry programs, which provide weekend nutritional
      support so kids show up ready to learn each Monday.
    </p>

    <p>
      This year, we’re setting up central donation points at participating
      supermarkets in Bozeman and Belgrade so that people can donate as they’re
      shopping. To volunteer click

    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Please fill out the volunteer form below and select a grocery store
        close to where you live. Volunteers are encouraged to pull together a
        small group of friends and family to join them in making this event a
        huge success.
      </p>
      <p>What we are asking:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Before the Event:</strong> Sign up on the form below to
          register at one of the local grocery stores for a two-hour shift. This
          is a large volunteer effort, so please make sure you are available at
          the time you sign up for, as rescheduling will be a challenge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Day of the Event:</strong> Show up at the supermarket
          you’ve signed up for. Employees of the food bank or volunteers from
          the previous shift will provide training. Volunteers will be
          responsible for handing out wish lists of desired donation items and
          receiving donations in our watermelon bins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>After the Event:</strong> As the food drive winds down, a
          truck or van will come to your location to pick up our food bins. The
          final volunteer shift (1:45-3 PM) will be responsible for waiting
          until the truck arrives. We expect all pick-up vehicles to arrive
          before by 3 but, if you are on the last shift, make sure your schedule
          is flexible in case there are unanticipated delays.
        </li>

      with Fight Childhood Hunger Week, <strong>April 5th – 9th</strong>.
      Raising awareness of the issue of childhood hunger while helping schools

        <h3>Impact:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            During the 2019-2020 fiscal year Gallatin Valley Food Bank
            distributed 1,904,499 pounds of food.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gallatin Valley Food Bank serves an average 1,160 households
            (roughly 3,000 individuals) every month by providing groceries at
            our Bozeman location and our satellite service in Belgrade.
          </li>
          <li>
            On average, 7,246 pounds (3.6 tons) of food is distributed to
            families every day.
          </li>
          <li>
            15% of households are single-parent families, 29% of households have
            at least one child, and 30% are under 18.
          </li>
          <li>
            Out of that total, 121,265 pounds of food went to other area
            nonprofits, the Fork and Spoon, CSFP and KidsPack. This took an
            extraordinary effort by hundreds of volunteers and dedicated staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Volunteers are vital to fighting hunger. While volunteering has
            looked different during COVID-19, volunteers are still the backbone
            of our efforts. Volunteers contribute tens of thousands of hours to
            help alleviate hunger in the Gallatin Valley.
          </li>
        </ul>
